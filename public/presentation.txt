Technologies we used
  Bootstrap
  Material UI

What did we disagree on
  What to prioritize
    I was focused on code organization and Alina wanted to do as much as we could in the given time.
  Solution
    We compromised

Something that didn't go according to plan
  Video Background
  Our server responses ended up being a little more dynamic then we first planned

Project Organization
  Alina and I both did what we felt passionate about and filled in the gaps if we had downtime
  We had two seperate branches on github that were seperated by person and we commited after major project milestones
